# reduxstore
## Description

This project was used to refactor the e-commerce platform to use [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) to manage global state. We were only given the documentation to follow in order to learn how to use new technology without being taught.

## User Story

```md
AS a senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform
I WANT my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API
SO THAT my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem
```

## Mock-Up

This section reviews the web application's general appearance and functionality.

The following animation shows how a user can register using the Signup page and then navigate to the Products page:

![A user registers on the Signup page and then navigates to the Products page, which displays images and descriptions of products.](./client/public/images/22-state-homework-demo-01.gif) 

The following animation shows how the user can select a category, choose a product, view details about it on the product page, and add and remove it from their shopping cart:

Finally, the user can check out by going to their shopping cart, as shown in the following animation:
